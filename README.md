This repository contains my Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) practice solutions from LeetCode, implemented primarily using C.  
The goal of this repository is to strengthen core DSA concepts, improve problem-solving skills, and prepare for coding interviews

🚀 About This Repository

📌 Problems are solved **using C language**
📈 Focus on **logic building, time & space optimization**
🧠 Covers fundamental to advanced **DSA topics**
🔄 Regularly updated as I solve more problems
🎯 Built for **interview preparation & consistency**

🛠️ Languages Known

Although I am comfortable with:
- C
- C++
- Python

👉 All solutions in this repository are intentionally written in **C** to strengthen low-level understanding and memory management concepts.
